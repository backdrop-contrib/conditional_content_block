# Conditional Text Block


## Description

This is a very simple module that offers a block type called "Conditional Text Block"
that offers two text fields. One field for unauthenticated users and another for 
authenticated users.

This module is in "proof of concept" stage. It works, but it's very simple and needs
input and feedback from the community. Also, it has not been properly tested yet
and does have bugs.

Pull Requests are welcome.

Please, offer feedback and ideas in the [issue queue](/backdrop-contrib/conditional_text_block/issues).
