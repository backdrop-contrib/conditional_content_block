# Conditional Content Block

This is a very simple module that offers a block type called "Conditional Content Block"
that offers two text fields (with WYSIWYG). The site editor is able to choose a single
role that will have access to each field. The most common use case would be one message
for unauthenticated users and another for authenticated users. But, other combinations
are possible. 

Please, offer feedback and ideas in the [issue queue](/backdrop-contrib/conditional_content_block/issues).

Pull Requests are welcome.
