# Conditional Content Block


## Description

This is a very simple module that offers a block type called "Conditional Content Block"
that offers two text fields. One field for unauthenticated users and another for 
authenticated users.

This module is in "proof of concept" stage. It works, but it's very simple and needs
input and feedback from the community. We are relatively new to writing modules from
scratch and not entirely sure what needs to go into a contrib module like this one.

Please, offer feedback and ideas in the [issue queue](/backdrop-contrib/conditional_content_block/issues).

Pull Requests are welcome.
