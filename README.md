# Conditional Content Block


## Description

This is a very simple module that offers a block type called "Conditional Content Block"
that offers two text fields. One field for unauthenticated users and another for 
authenticated users.

Normally, I would solve this problem with two blocks placed in the same region, one with
a visibility condition for unauthenticated users and one with a visibility condition for
authenticated users. While this works fine, it's a bit cumbersome to manage and I love
the idea of one block for one purpose, even if there it has more than one audience.

This module is in "proof of concept" stage. It works, but it's very simple and needs
input and feedback from the community. Most of my experience is with helping to maintain
existing contrib modules or adding new themes. I need help and advice on creating 
contrib modules for Backdrop CMS. What things do I need to consider that I have not
thought of already?

I've posted some questions in the module issue queue that I would like feedback on.

Please, offer feedback and ideas in the [issue queue](/backdrop-contrib/conditional_content_block/issues).

Pull Requests are welcome.
